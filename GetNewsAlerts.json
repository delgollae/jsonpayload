Leveraging latest developments in all medical specialties, the hospital is set to represent a quantum leap in integrated health care services provided in the UAE.He added that the medical personnel attached to the Group are leading professionals who remain updated on latest developments in the implementation, operation and development of health facilities through participating in specialized forums and exhibitions.Al-Habib added: “Our continuous keenness has resulted in several strategic partnerships with major international companies such as GE for diagnostic radiology devices, and Drager for medical gas. Stryker will provide the best types of beds at the new multidisciplinary hospital. We also share a strong association with Roche Laboratories of Germany and other medical companies that have a long tradition in this area.Princess Haya, together with Al-Habib and HE Raja Al Gurg, Vice-Chairperson of DHCA and HE Essa Al Maydour, director general of Dubai Health Authority and the DHCA Board Members, visited the facilities at the Dr. Sulaiman Al-Habib Medical Center.Princess Haya was given a brief tour by Dr. Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Center’s medical director, Dr. Naji Yazbek, as well as other doctors at the facility, where She was shown the medical center’s Dental Department, including the latest dental machines from Sirona, and ophthalmology suites with Visumax, the latest eye vision correction technology in the Middle East.Afterwards, Princess Haya was escorted to the Radiology Department, which includes the latest MRI and CT Scan Angiogram from GE, and lastly, and the Laboratory, where patients are able to do up to 160 different tests on just one blood sample.Al-Habib also expressed his appreciation of the efforts and support extended by the Dubai Healthcare City Authority and Dubai Government.
